**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This repo is _very_ dated and has not been actively maintained for quite some time now. This functionality is now a native part of Tableau so this effort was no longer necessary and anyone using this extension should move to the officially supported functionality. Additionally, as of March 4, 2022 I have departed my position at Tableau so will no longer be providing any updates or support on this project.
